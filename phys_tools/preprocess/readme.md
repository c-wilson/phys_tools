===

These are a collection of scripts to go from data off a SpikeGL or OpenEphys rig to:
* Row-major binary files suitable for spikesorting ("dat" files)
* A metadata file consisting of extracted metadata from Voyeur and from auxillary ephys channels
* A LFP file storing a 1 kHz downsampled representation of the neural traces in HDF5 format.
* Extract relevant timepoints from sniff traces.
